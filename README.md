STEPHANIE'S FISH CATCHING MICROGAME:
# Fish-Catching-Microgame

A microgame (minigame) that I created for the course Programming Interactive Graphics in 2021!

- The objective of this microgame is to use the mouse to catch the orange fish while avoiding the purple fish (piranhas)!

- This project uses the p5 library. The p5 library therefore should be located in the same folder as index.html and Fish_Catching_Microgame.js in order for
  the game to run smoothly. If this is not the case, then change the directory to p5 in index.html.

- For the best Fish Microgame experience, access the index.html file through a local server. This can be done by installing NodeJS onto your computer
  and using the http-server command within the same directory as index.html.

- Thank you and happy gaming! :)
