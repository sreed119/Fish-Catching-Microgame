STEPHANIE'S FISH CATCHING MICROGAME:
# Fish-Catching-Microgame

A microgame (minigame) that I created for the course Programming Interactive Graphics in 2021!

- The objective of this microgame is to use the mouse to catch the orange fish while avoiding the purple fish (piranhas)!

- Thank you and happy gaming! :)
